# recurrence-interval-program

The Recurrence Interval Program analyzes time-series data for event occurrences. It reads data points from a user-specified file, calculates the intervals between events, and provides a statistical analysis of these intervals. The user also enters a time frame, and the program outputs the probability of the next event occurring within that time frame. The program assumes a log-normal distribution to calculate the probability of future events within a given time frame.
